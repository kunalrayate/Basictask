#   Java BasicTask - Internship Console Applications

# Overview

**BasicTask** is a collection of beginner-friendly Java console applications developed as part of an internship to demonstrate understanding of core Java concepts such as loops, conditionals, exception handling, recursion, and user interaction. The project is structured into different packages, each representing a separate task or functionality.

These mini applications are suitable for educational or demonstration purposes and can be extended into larger software systems in the future.

## 🎯 Features and Tasks:

### ✅ Task 1: Basic Calculator

A console-based calculator that performs fundamental arithmetic operations.

- **Add Numbers** – Computes the sum of two integers.
- **Subtract Numbers** – Computes the difference between two integers.
- **Multiply Numbers** – Computes the product of two integers.
- **Divide Numbers** – Computes the quotient, with proper handling for division by zero.

> Includes proper input validation using `try-catch` and `Scanner`.

### ✅ Task 2: Number Guessing Game

A fun interactive guessing game using Java’s `Random` class.

- Program generates a random number.
- User has a limited number of attempts to guess it.
- Feedback provided:
  - “Too high”
  - “Too low”
  - “Correct guess”
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully.

### ✅ Task 3: Factorial Calculation using Recursion

This task demonstrates the use of recursion to calculate factorial of a number.

- Recursively computes `n!`
- Handles edge cases:
  - Factorial of 0 = 1
  - Negative number = error message
